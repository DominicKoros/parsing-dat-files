# Parse data files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A particular dat file format is needed to parse anything, something related to pigeons...

## How to use!
### Install the Requirements.
1. open up a terminal in the same folder as the code
2. run the following `pip install -r requirements.txt` (this downloads and installs 2 projects this code depends on)
### Running the File
1. then we can run `python app.py "name of .dat file"`
     - an example of this would be `python app.py to_be_parsed.dat`
2. if everything goes well it should say success and give you the name of the Excel file it created. TADA!
